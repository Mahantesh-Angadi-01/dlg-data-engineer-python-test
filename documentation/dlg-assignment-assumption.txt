Assumptions

1. The pyarrow module is installed, otherwise the following imports will throw an error - No module named 'pyarrow'

   If not installed and get an error of - No module named 'pyarrow'
   
   Then use one of the following:
   
   pyarrow with the conda package manager : conda install pyarrow -c conda-forge
   OR
   install binary wheels from PyPI with pip : pip install pyarrow


2. For the statement in the pdf "Convert the weather data into parquet format", I have assumed that, I have to convert every csv into respective parquet file - as one to one.


3. I have displayed/logged every stage of the process, which can be found in the "dlg-assignment-log-and-test-results.txt" file
   - Reading CSV files & Printing the numberof reacords in each file
   - Converting & Writing into Parquet files
   - Reading Parquet files into Pandas
   - Querying the data (for 3 results) from the Pandas and display the results which are displayed towards the end

4. Assumed the following Directory Structure
   C:\temp\dlg\documentation	: For documentations
   C:\temp\dlg\scripts		: For scripts
   C:\temp\dlg\raw		: For raw csv files
   C:\temp\dlg\parquet		: For parquet files
